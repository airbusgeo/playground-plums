|Plums|

Welcome to *Plums* ! If you are here, it is probably because you work in the field of machine learning, more
specifically on aerial imagery with a strong geo-spatial bias, and you are tired of re-inventing the wheel every time
you start a new data science project or you would like for your team to work on a common ground so that sharing code and
working with other people is actually an *asset* and not a *hassle*. Well in that case, welcome to *Plums*.


What is Plums ?
---------------

Plums stands for the **PL**\ ayground **U**\ nified **M**\ icrolib **S**\ et, and it is a set of geo-spatial oriented
data science *Python* packages originally built around the *Intelligence Playground* to make the lives of
data-scientists easier. But even more so *Plums* aims to be more of an development and team environment, and is built
as a collection of semi-independent packages built on a common data-model.


Installation
------------

Those packages puropose is to set a unique baseline to help make the code base more unified and avoid countless
reimplementation of the same tools which in turns make people waste time and make the code base herd to understand,
debug and reuse.

Installation is simple with *PyPI* repository:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install playground-plums

What's next ?
-------------

The base library :ref:`commons_quickstart` offers a quick glance at the *Plums* data-model and coding philosophy and
is a good start for new *Plums* users.

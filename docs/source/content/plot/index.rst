|Plums| Plot
============

.. include:: ../../include.rst

The Plums **plot** package aims to offer a set of lightweight highly reusable classes and utilities for
visualizing detection an segmentation results.

It offers both a user friendly high-level python API (documented as the *User* API) and a set of highly
customizable classes which composes a powerful although somewhat *low-level* API (documented as the *Developer* API).

.. seealso::
    :doc:`/api_doc/plums.plot.index` for more information on both API and their intended purpose.
